# Data Analytics Capstone

In this capstone, we will be working on a project that is two-fold. First, we want to build a tool (e.g., a dashboard) that food pantry organizers and policy makers can use to target food insecurity across the US at the block level. Second, we want to help understand what demographic characterstics are driving, or at least associated with, food insecurity. 

This is similar to what you did in Stat 172, but the data is much more comprehensive. 

We will be using Github as our primary medium for course materials. You will use Github to
1. Turn in reading assignments. See "Reading Assignment" folder. 
Turn in your responses by simply writing your answer within the .Rmd file I've started for you and compiling to pdf. (This files contains the questions.)
2. Keep me in the loop on your coding progress. Make sure to push (and pull) regularly! This will serve as a part of your progress reports outside of your verbal presentation. 

See our syllabus for more details.
